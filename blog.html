											<b>Rebuild and Relaunch</b> <br>
											<br>
											1. If you read the 'About' page, you have seen the news. swanLAN now operates on Rocky-Linux. The change has generated a number of
											improvements such as running in text-only mode. Server performance is vastly improved. Many thanks to the support from Rocky-Linux 
											forums.  <br>
											<br>
											2. Additions to the site: Ummm ... no. I am still selecting what services to run. I am enjoying FAST server performance internally 
											and externally. I like operating a lean server. What is next? I am not sure. I intend to get better crypto on the server. I am 
											paying for it but so far the installation process has eluded me. After that, I'm not sure. Suggestions are welcome. Changes will be
                                 announced in these pages. <br>
											<br>   
											Have a very Happy New Year
											<br>
											Dave

											<b>Continued Progress</b> <br>
											<br>
											1. Progress continues and I am - for once - very pleased with the results. Some surprises int he logs but I am progressively 
											investigating those error reports and getting them sorted out. The latest fun was seeing my error messages working correctly. <br>
											<br>
											2. Additions to the site: The County Central High School [unofficial] Graduation page. Access is from the links/Media page. <br>
											<br>
											3. Time to spend some time checking security processes.<br> 
											<br>   
											Enjoy.

											<b>Starting Over</b> <br>
											<br>
											1. Despite the service I was running, there were some things in the background that refused to work. Internal server mail was awful. I regularly encountered problems
											that inferred everything would work if I just used one of the paid versions. - Not gonna happen. I never did get full control of the user accounts which CentOS 
											operates in a non-standard mode. When I had trouble getting services to work smoothly for internal and external clients, I realised this was probably beyond the 
											intention of the OS<br>
											<br>
											2. During May I formatted the server and started over, this time using CentOS. That said I have a background in OpenSUSE and Mageia. I have also used Red Hat - a long
											time ago. The standard installation processes combined with solid online documentation had me restart all services and make progress on several personal projects. <br>
											<br>
											3. Bottom line, the server is back up. All services are back up. Performance is also up.<br> 
											<br>   
											Enjoy.    
											<br>
											Dave

											Eating an Elephant ... <b>Continued</b><br>
											<br>
											1. The big news ... I finally got the security certificates installed correctly. Let's Encrypt gets the credit for a good process. 
											I used Webmin to import the certificate and bingo bango bongo SwanLAN was operating on a valid certificate certificate - or at least
											that part of it.<br>
											<br>
											2. As inferred above, Webmin and Usermin are installed and operating smoothly. YAY!<br>
											<br>
											3. The <b>Minecraft 1.15.2. server</b> continues to work reasonably well. The server generated a raid and killed off most of the NPC 
											in Sudbury. That's life on a survival server.<br> 
											<br>   
											More soon.    
											<br>

											Progress is <b>SLOW</b><br>
											<br>
											1. ClearOS continues to be stable - with limitations. They want users to pay for some services so you have to be prepared to 
											do a fair bit of digging to get what you want as opposed to what they want to give you. Samba does not work the way I think it should. <br>
											<br>
											2. Customizing Apache turned into an epic fail. ClearOS could not easily tell me directory/file ownership and permissions. The result 
											was Apache became pretty cranky demanding user names and passwords. I got everything reset - eventually.<br>
											<br>
											3. I did get some of my favourite tools installed, thanks to those additional repositories. That was ultimately what helped me sort out Apache. <br>
											<br>
											4. Minecraft (Java) is running and stable under amp. Amp is proving a pain to restart. I have a number of options, none of which seem to work 
											consistently. If I have to reboot the server, I download an amp update - required or not - install it and boot from it. Not pretty but it works. 
											Current Minecraft version is 1.15.2 <br>
											<br>  
											More soon.    
											<br>

										<p>
											And we have some progress! <br>
											<br>
											1. I was able to add some repositories to ClearOS. This gave me the ability to add some additional software. The reference is
											https://www.tecmint.com/yum-thirdparty-repositories-for-centos-rhel/ Follow the instructions carefully and you will be fine. If
											you don't understand the instructions - your not ready yet. <br>
											<br>
											2. I found the location of the control file for Apache (the web server) ... seems ClearOS hides them. Apache is on its way to
											doing what I want it to do. <br>
											<br>
											3. Next Step: Validate the security systems. I am looking ahead to several forms of information sharing. Before I do that, security 
											has to be robust. <br>
											<br>
											More soon.    
											<br>

											I am not much of a blogger. I'd apologise but there has been a lot going on.<br>
											<br>
											1. There has been a full server re-load. I had made a few mistakes during my first attempt to build and run this server. You always 
											learn what isn't in the documentation the first time around. 
											<br>
											2. Amp is proving to be a very solid way of running Minecraft. Updates have occurred to both amp and Minecraft seamlessly. Current 
											version of AMP is 1.9.1.2 Current version of Minecraft is 1.15.1 
											<br>
											3. Overall the server, AMP and Minecraft have been stable enough that I will extending invitations to add to the website, and to 
											Minecraft. I regularly look at new services ... but sanity prevails and I am only trying one or two things at a time. If you have 
											a preference or suggestion please ask. File Sharing services are NOT in my plans. Too many legal issues. 
											<br> 
											4. I should add that for a guy like me, ClearOS is proving a real winner. System overhead is very low. This server runs smoothly 
											in the background (as a good server should), providing email, groupware, network file sharing and web services very smoothly. The 
											automatic updates save me maintenance time. They do want to charge for security updates, but that can be avoided with a little 
											bit of thought. AMP is providing me with the ability to add many things - however I am taking my time before I add additional 
											services.
											<br>
											Thanks for visiting. Drop me a line sometime.

										<b>Political Rant</b><span><a href="#">18 Oct 2019</a><a href="#">David Swan</a></span>

											<p>I am disappointed. I was really looking forward to asking a lot of questions at an all-candidates forum. Most of the political 
											parties did not answer the invitation, much less provide any information. The material available on their websites is carefully 
											crafted nonsense. Since I have no hope of making a logical, fact based electoral decision, I thought I’d post my general observations 
											to social media, taking note of Mark Twain’s observation: </p><br>
											<p>“Politicians and diapers must be changed often, and for the same reason.”<br>
											Mark Twain
											</p><br>
											<p>First question to the Liberals and Conservatives: You have lied to me so many times over my lifetime, why should I consider voting 
									for either of you?</p> 
									<br>
									<p>Second question for the NDP: Almost every NDP government in my lifetime has run up deficits and/or trashed the economy. Why should 
									I trust you with the Federal economy? Especially after what Rachael Notley did to Alberta’s economy.</p>
									<br>
									<p>And a followup: Why should I trust the unions that support the NDP any more an I trust the corporations that support the Liberal 
									and the Conservatives?</p>
									<br> 
									<p>Third question is for the Green party: If Greenland was named that because it was GREEN and there are fossilized trees on Ellesmere 
									Island doesn’t that that suggest there always has been climate change – and always will be. So my question is what is: green enough? 
									We know you want to close the Oil and Gas Industry. What I don’t know is your vision … what industries do you promote? And saying 
									green industries does not count. Be specific.</p>
									<br>
									<p>And a follow-up: Do you understand that if you wreck the federal economy there won’t be any money to make the changes you advocate? 
									</p><br>
									<p>Fourth question, for the People’s Party: Bernie I remember you and the “biker chick”, the secret files you left at her place, my 
									question is can you get a security clearance? Should I take you seriously? I mean your immigration policy runs counter to Canadian 
									experience, well English Canadian experience. 
									</p><br>
									<p>Fifth question for the Liberals and the Conservatives: Why are relations with a mainland China, a communist government with a 
									terrible human rights record more important than working with Taiwan, a democracy? If you don’t like that question we could discuss 
									Russia versus Ukraine, or Georgia … 
									</p><br>
									<p>Last question: No Canadian political party has invested seriously in the Canadian military in more than forty years. How do you 
									intend to screw over the military and veterans this time?
									</p><br>
									<p>Maybe I should give the various political parties some credit. They didn’t show up for an all-candidates meeting moderated by a 
									38 year veteran with PTSD.

											This template was designed for a gaming website, but it is a starting place. Don't like it - TOUGH! If you can't take my sense of humour better leave now. <br>
											<br>
											Some placeholders are being left in place to help me grow the site. The only pages I have spent any time on are the About and the Blog pages. So far that means this is a 'manual site' with code inserted using 'Bluefish' software. That said - so far so good. Now if I can just sort out the header we can get this posted. Maybe we can even turn over some admin to Stewie!
