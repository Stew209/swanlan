									<h3>Welcome to SwanLAN!</h3>

										<p>
											You have reached swanlan.org.com a webserver operated by the Swan family of Vulcan, Alberta Canada. We host a few personal websites, as well as a Minecraft server.
											</p> 
										<p>
											The material on this server is intended for: our development, education/instruction and/or entertainment. It is a work in progress as we learn 'how-to' operate the services of the website.
											</p>

											28 Dec 2021 Overall Assessment: Service delivery continues to be stable. No known issues. 
											<p>
										</p>

											David Swan is responsible for the operation of this server. You can reach his NetWork Administrator for your questions, comments and/or inquiries at swanlan209@yahoo.ca.

									<h3>Technical Information</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
										This server is operating on a fiber-optic network, provided through Axia. Their information is at https://www.axia.com/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/axia-logo-bell.gif" width="149" height="43" alt="Axia" longdesc="Axia Logo">
										</p>
										<p>
											The server is running on Rocky-Linux. Their information can be found at https://www.rockylinux.org/  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/rockylinux/original/1X/4d1b01aa75efe72c352cccf93abc939ccdef91ed.png>
											<br>
											<br>
											I started using Linux in 2000. With the experience of many Linux server editions including: Mandriva, Mageia, CentOS, Red Hat, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE and now Rocky-Linux this has been one of the fastest and satisfying setups I have encountered.

									<h3>Site Services & Status</h3>

											28 Dec 2021<br>
											The Red Hat change of direction for CentOS drove a series of changes for swanLAN. First was the necessity of finding a new stable Linux platform. When Rocky-Linux
											was announced with the same folks who started CentOS, it seemed like a no-brainer decision to me. Throw in the learning curve, some hardware upgrades and
											you have a prolonged 'down-time'. swanLAN was here and working, but just for me. I am still selecting and installing services. The basics appear to be 
											running securely and efficiently. <br>
											As always, questions, comments and requests to swanlan209@yahoo.ca

											To make a long story short I ran out of patience with ClearOS. It has some fine strengths - it is very easy to install and activate basic services however its unique user control and 
											systems are designed to drive you to pay for their enterprise system. Not what I wanted for a friends and family server.<br>
											<br>
											This time I tried CentOS. I installed a basic server (ver 8.1), with GUI and that proved to be the necessary magic. So we are back.<br> 
											<br> 
											Net down time was less than a month. Actually it was about two weeks before all services were restored. I have some clean-up to do, but services including Minecraft are operating,
											With a bit of luck my users won't see a thing.     
										</p>
										<p>25 December 2019<br>
										The server went offline, no indication as to why. MY best guess at this point is that IT tried to reboot after some updates and ran into my instruction to shut down and NOT automatically reboot. AMP has been updated as has Minecraft. Overall performance has exceeded my expectations.  
										</p>

											Thank you to websmythe who was our Alpha tester for the website. My first blog is posted. Minecraft is also up and running. More in progress. 
										</p>
										<p>
											18th September 2019 <br> 
										   The web-server was activated yesterday. <br> <br>
										   Once the root web server is up the next service will be the Minecraft server. a Cyber security site/blog is being planned. Check the site 'Blog' for notes on service activation.   
										   <br>
										   <br>
										   We will NOT be providing 'file sharing services' so don't bother asking.
